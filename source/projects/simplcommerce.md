description: A super simple, cross platform, modularized ecommerce system built on .NET Core.
---

The first ecommerce system built on .NET Core.

ASP.NET Core is a new open-source and cross-platform framework for building modern cloud-based Web applications using .NET. We built it from the ground up to provide an optimized development framework for apps that are either deployed to the cloud or run on-premises. It consists of modular components with minimal overhead, so you retain flexibility while constructing your solutions. You can develop and run your ASP.NET Core applications cross-platform on Windows, Mac and Linux.
