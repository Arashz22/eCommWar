Cartridge is a shopping cart application built using the [Django](http://djangoproject.com/)
framework. It is [BSD licensed](http://www.linfo.org/bsdlicense.html), and designed to provide a clean and
simple base for developing e-commerce websites. It purposely does not
include every conceivable feature of an e-commerce website; instead,
Cartridge focuses on providing core features common to most e-commerce
websites.

This specific focus stems from the idea that every e-commerce website
is different, is tailored to the particular business and products at
hand, and should therefore be as easy to customize as possible.
Cartridge achieves this goal with a code-base that is as simple as
possible and implements only the core features of an e-commerce
website.

Cartridge extends the [Mezzanine](http://mezzanine.jupo.org/) content management platform. A live
demo of Cartridge can be found by visiting the [Mezzanine live demo](http://mezzanine.jupo.org/).
