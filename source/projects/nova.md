An attempt to port/rebuild [Spree](http://spreecommerce.com), an open source e-commerce solution, with [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/).


## Vision
Spree is an excellent product however,
for several reasons, it started to show some _limits_:

* being written in Ruby and Rails requires a lot of hosting resources
* it became a big, monolithic piece of software, really hard to customize
* it slowed down the development pace (_perhaps_ because of the point above)

So here's the deal: why not to port/rebuild Spree with Elixir and Phoenix? The main
idea is to take inspiration from the many _Spree's good parts_ and build a new
generation ecommerce for the next years.
