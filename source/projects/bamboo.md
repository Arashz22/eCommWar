description: Meet Bamboo, an e-commerce project built on top of Elcodi and Symfony.
---

Welcome to Bamboo e-commerce - a fully-functional e-commerce application built
using [Elcodi] components on top of the [Symfony] framework.

Yes, you got it right! Bamboo uses the Symfony framework but our components are
framework agnostic, that is, they only depend on the Symfony components as 
opposed to the whole framework or any of its distributions.

Why should I use Bamboo? That's simple, to sell your products. We provide you 
with an interface to sell your products and manage your store. You only have to 
focus on offering a good product, we take care of the rest.

Elcodi was awarded as the **Best Open Source** project of 2015 by the Symfony
Community awards.
