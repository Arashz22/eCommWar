Aimeos is an open source e-commerce framework for web shops consisting of the e-commerce library, the administration interface and different front-ends. It's a modular stack that offers an unmatched combination of flexibility and speed.

Contrary to other web shops, Aimeos is no monolithic application. Instead, you have the choice between several user front-ends and you can adapt them to your needs or write one of your own one.
