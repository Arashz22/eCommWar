## An eCommerce Experiment with Elixir and OTP

Peach is an API-only eCommerce storefront. For now there is no templating, no HTML, etc - it's just an API. I started out with Phoenix and decided that it didn't quite fit what I wanted so I switch over to [Maru](https://github.com/falood/maru) - a small, Grape-inspired API front end. It fits perfectly.

I also was thinking about [Trot](https://github.com/hexedpackets/trot) but decided that I wanted to leave the CMS/HTML stuff to a framework or application that is very good at it; Peach can be just one part of the puzzle.

I've been [writing a blog series](http://rob.conery.io/category/redfour) about creating an eCommerce store with Elixir and I plan to continue on, as this is an application that I'll need very soon. You're welcome to help :).
