description: QOR is a set of libraries written in Go that abstracts common features needed for business applications, CMSs, and E-commerce systems.

QOR is architected from the ground up to accelerate development and deployment of Content Management Systems, E-commerce Systems, and Business Applications. QOR is comprised of modules that abstract common features for such systems, such as a configurable and flexible back office, a content publishing system, a media library, and much more.

We built QOR at The Plant to accelerate development for our clients, it is at the core of our engineering strategy, and we maintain it on an ongoing basis. This is a complete rewrite of the original QOR, which was a proprietary framework written in Ruby on Rails. QOR 1.0 is the first version to be open sourced and distributed under the MIT license.
