# The Rules

Everybody is welcome to contribute to eCommWar, just fork the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/eCommWar/eCommWar) and send a pull request.
Each e-commerce platform is a markdown file in the `source/projects` directory.

We'll only accept pull requests adding new e-commerce platforms if they follow the following rules:

*   **Open Source:** The platform must be released under an open source license.
*   **Accessible on GitHub:** The platform must have a public repository on Github that we can link to and pull in stats from.
*   **Stick to the format:** Fill out all the same fields as the other e-commerce platforms in `source/projects`.
